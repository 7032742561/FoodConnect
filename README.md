# FoodConnect
To supply leftover food to poor
FoodConnect is a platform that reduces food waste and helps underserved communities. By 
using Salesforce, it connects food donors (like restaurants or event venues) with volunteers who 
collect and deliver surplus food to those in need. The platform uses automated workflows and 
dashboards to make the process simple and efficient.
